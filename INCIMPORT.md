### **Issue: Incorrect Import in `flutter_local_notifications-umbrella.h` on macOS**

#### **Overview**:
If you're running your Flutter project on a macOS emulator (desktop target), you might encounter a build error related to the import style in the generated umbrella header.

#### **Flutter Version:**
- **Flutter**: 3.27.1 (Stable)
- **Dart SDK**: 3.6.0 (Stable)

#### **Affected File:**
- **File**: `Peanut-Progress-Habit-Tracker/macos/Pods/Target Support Files/flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications-umbrella.h`

#### **Error Message:**
When trying to run your project on a macOS emulator, the following error will appear:

```
Peanut-Progress-Habit-Tracker/macos/Pods/Target Support Files/flutter_local_notifications/flutter_local_notifications-umbrella.h:13:9: error: double-quoted include "Converters.h" in framework header, expected angle-bracketed instead
** BUILD FAILED **
```

#### **Temporary Workaround:**
If you encounter this issue, you can resolve it temporarily by modifying the generated header file:

- **Before:**
  ```objc
  #import "Converters.h"
  ```

- **After:**
  ```objc
  #import <flutter_local_notifications/Converters.h>
  ```

This change should allow the build to complete successfully when running the project on a macOS emulator.

#### **How to Apply the Workaround:**
1. Navigate to the `macos/Pods/Target Support Files/flutter_local_notifications/` directory in your Flutter project.
2. Open the `flutter_local_notifications-umbrella.h` file.
3. Modify the import statement from:
   ```objc
   #import "Converters.h"
   ```
   to:
   ```objc
   #import <flutter_local_notifications/Converters.h>
   ```
4. Save the changes and run your project again on the macOS emulator.
